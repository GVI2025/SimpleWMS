# Git Practice Instructions: fetch, pull, merge, rebase

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup (5 min)
Start by creating your own branch ([TRIGRAM]/git) from the current one.
From here, you‚Äôll use this branch to explore different Git commands.

---

## üîç Exercise 1: git fetch (10 min)

A remote branch named `course/git/git-fetch` contains updates.

1. Use `git fetch` to retrieve remote changes.
2. Without checking it out, figure out:
   - What commits are in `course/git/git-fetch` but not in your current branch?
      - `git diff TTC/git remotes/origin/course/git/git-fetch --name-only`
      - Ca √©crit les fichiers de diff√©rences (fichiers) entre les deux branches. Si on souhaite voir le contenu, on peut enlever `--name-only`
   - What files changed?
      - app/seed/seed_data.py

> You are not expected to merge. Just observe.

Afterward, regroup and discuss:
- What `git fetch` does:
  - Downloads new data from remote repository
  - Updates remote tracking branches
  - Does NOT automatically merge changes into working files
  - Does NOT modify your local working directory

- When to use `git fetch`:
  - To see what others have been working on without integrating changes
  - To review changes before merging
  - To stay up-to-date with remote repository while working on local changes
  - When you want to check remote changes but aren't ready to merge

---

## üîÑ Exercise 2: git pull (10 min)

You now want to sync with `course/git/git-pull`.

1. Pull the branch into your current branch.
2. Analyze the result:
   - Was it fast-forward or did Git create a merge commit?
      - fast-forward, pas de merge, juste un nouveau fichier
   - Check your commit graph.
      - On peut voir les commits de la branche git-pull

Discuss:
- The difference between `git pull` and `git fetch + merge`:
  - `git pull` automatically merges changes into your working branch
  - `git fetch + merge` gives you more control by separating the steps
  - `git pull` is essentially a shortcut for `git fetch` followed by `git merge`

- Use cases and default behavior:
  - Default: `git pull` does a fast-forward merge when possible
  - Use `git pull` when you want to quickly sync with remote changes
  - Use `git fetch + merge` when you want to:
    - Review changes before merging
    - Have more control over the merge process
    - Potentially use different merge strategies

## üîÄ Exercise 3: git merge without conflict (10 min)

The branch `course/git/git-merge-without-conflict` is clean and can be merged directly.

1. Merge the branch.
2. Check your Git history:
   - Is the merge linear?
      - Oui, pas de probl√®me
   - Was a merge commit created?
      - Apparemment non

---

## ‚öîÔ∏è Exercise 4: git merge with conflict (10 min)

Now try merging `course/git/git-merge-with-conflict` into your branch.

1. Attempt the merge.
2. Resolve the conflicts.
3. Commit the result.

Observation:
- What files conflicted?
- How did Git mark the conflict?

---

## üß¨ Exercise 5: git rebase without conflict (10 min)

Use the branch `course/git/git-rebase-without-conflict`.

1. Rebase its content onto your current branch.
2. Compare the result to a merge.

---

## üî• Exercise 6: git rebase with conflict (15 min)

Try rebasing `course/git/git-rebase-with-conflict` onto your branch.

1. Resolve conflicts.
2. Use `git rebase --continue`.
3. If necessary, abort with `git rebase --abort`.

Observe:
- How does the history differ from a merge?
- What are the pros/cons of rebasing in this context?

---

## üß™ Bonus: Inspect the seed data

Each branch modifies some of the same entries in `seed_data.py`, especially:
- Articles‚Äô names and SKUs
- Implantation or Mission quantities

You can inspect these differences manually or using:
```bash
git diff origin/course/git/git-merge-with-conflict
```
or
```bash
git log -p origin/course/git/git-rebase-with-conflict
```

This helps understand what causes merge or rebase conflicts.

## ‚úÖ Wrap-up

- You should now know when to use `fetch`, `pull`, `merge`, and `rebase`.
- You should understand how Git tracks divergence and handles conflicts.
